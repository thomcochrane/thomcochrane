<p>The built-in camera on smartphones can record video and audio at up to almost DVD quality. This facilitates student's recording</p>
<p>events, interviews, and reflections with a vidual dimension, and sharing these online via a variety of mobile friendly video sites</p>
<p>such as YouTube. Video streaming applications such as Qik and Flixwagon allow real-time sharing of video directly from smartphones</p>
<p>to these web-based services. Qik and Flixwagon then archive the video stream for later viewing, sharing and commenting. Additionally</p>
<p>video streaming sites integrate with other mobile web 2 technologies such as Twitter - creating an automatic announcement on Twitter</p>
<p>regarding a live video stream that a student's Twitter followers could then watch in almost real-time. Qik and Flixwagon also feature</p>
<p>the ability to forward video streams to a users YouTube account for sharing on that service as well. Qik supports the association of </p>
<p>geolocation data with video streams, providing a Google Maps link to the actual location of the recorded event.</p>
