Students and teaching staff are provided with a 3G smartphone with a 1GB/month mobile broadband account plus a personal voice account (Students are responsible for paying for voice calls and txt messages, while the 1GB data plan costs are reimbursed by the project) for the duration of the trial (2008). Internet connectivity is also available via the Unitec WiFi network while on campus. This provides faster, free web access while on campus. As the previous trial in 2007 indicated that the limitations of text entry on the smartphones was significant in hindering student reflection, participants in the 2008 trial are also provided with a folding Bluetooth keyboard that can be paired to their smartphone.

The smartphone's wireless connectivity and data gathering abilities ( e.g. photoblogging, video recording, voice recording, and text input) allow for bridging the on and off campus learning contexts - facilitating &quot;real world learning&quot;.
<br><br>The core activity of the project is the creation and maintenance of a reflective Blog as part of a course group project. Additionally a variety of mobile friendly web 2 tools are used in conjunction with the smartphone. The trials investigate how the smartphone can be used to enhance almost any aspect of the course. The project uses the smartphone and Personal Computers for a variety of activities.<br><br>
The choice of mobile device for each trial is based on the best fit of features with the key requirements of each course. Previous trials identified the importance of a ubiquitous connection to the Internet for student productivity across multiple contexts, and the preference of students and tutors to carry a single device (i.e. a cellphone); hence preference was given to smartphones over WiFi capable PDAs. Common specifications required include: WiFi capability for free web access while on campus, 3G for fast web access off campus, a built-in camera, media playback, multitasking operating system for instant messaging capability, alternative text entry capability, support for key web 2 applications. Windows Mobile devices and were not considered based on their small marketshare, instability, and inherent &quot;uncoolness&quot; for students. Palm smartphones had been trialed initially in 2007 but had been rejected by students because of the poor quality of the built-in camera, 'clunky' form-factor, and aging OS. Budget was another factor, limiting the cost of the device to $700NZ each. To keep the cost of the devices down, the smartphones were purchased 'unlocked' through parallel importers.
